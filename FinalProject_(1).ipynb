Questions are worth one point each, unless they contain a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è next to them, in which case they are worth two points (e.g. **Question 1.2. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è**). In most cases, questions worth two points are longer and more challenging than questions worth one point, though sometimes two point questions are themselves straightforward, but used to test the correctness of a previously implemented function.\n",

        "Welcome to the Final Project! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is comprehensive, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, since problems can vary quite a bit in difficulty, some problems will be worth more points than others. Finally, in a project, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life\".\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important that you **start early** on the project! It is the final assignment that is due this quarter, but it is due just a few days before the Final Exam. You are especially encouraged to **find a partner** to work through the project with. You can work with anyone from any section of the course, but you must follow the [Project Partner Guidelines](https://dsc10.com/project-partners/) on the course website. In particular, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project, and you are not allowed to split up the problems and each work on certain problems. If working in a pair, you should submit one notebook to Gradescope for the both of you.\n",

If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). Directly sharing answers between groups is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",

For example, the reboot *How I Met Your Father* is based on the original *How I Met Your Mother*. Other examples include *That 90's Show*, a reboot of *That 70's Show*, and *Fuller House*, a reboot of *Full House*.\n",

We'll continue adding new words after each previous word, until we encounter a word that never had any words after it in an episode title (like `'Proposes'` in our example above).

In our case, we'll keep adding new words as long as the DataFrame returned by `find_prob_dist` has at least one row, since that means there are more words we can add to our title.

With a relatively small body of text in *Friends* episode titles, there are many words that can only be followed by one thing.
